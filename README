Streaming HTML Server
=====================

The goal of this is to demonstrate a server that can stream html out of order. 

This will be based on the work at [lamplightdev](https://lamplightdev.com/blog/2024/01/10/streaming-html-out-of-order-without-javascript/)
and [SWTL](https://github.com/thepassle/swtl?tab=readme-ov-file).

The server will be built using [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/).
